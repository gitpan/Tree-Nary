Installation Instructions
-------------------------

Usually all you have to do is:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

If that fails, regard the following instructions step by step.

1)  Generate the Makefile: perl Makefile.PL

2)  Compile the module: make

3)  Test the module: make test

4)  To install the module in your perl tree:  "make install"
    You may need to su root before this step.
